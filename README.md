# Project 3 - *Yelpee*

**Yelpee** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What are some better ways to display features for a better User Experience?
2. The Search bar was added programmatically to the navigation controller. How can we add things to the navigation controller both programmatically and through the storyboard. 
3. Similar to Q2, if we wanted to hide the search bar and only have it available when you click the navigation controller title, is that possible?
